Report - The html and css part was simple for me. I used a video of youtube, and followed a walkthrough. 
I was very comfortable with that part of the challenge. 
The javascript file I had to research up on prototypes, as it was my first time using them.
I used iteration code throughout the file, I believe I would like to try and rewrite this quiz using recursion techniques in the future
