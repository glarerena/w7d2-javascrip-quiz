I followed a 20 minute walk through video on Youtube
It has the styling, and the html broken down very good.
I understood all of this very well.
The javascript was also here, but it was not explained very well in the video.
The quiz is functional.
The youtube video was Build A Quiz App using HTML, CSS, and javascript by Devression
The questions array is set up, so I can continue to add as many questions to my quiz as I would like.
